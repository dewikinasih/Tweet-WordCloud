I created a wordcloud to visualize text data that i have taken from twitter by crawling.
I would like to know what are people out there (especially twitter user) talking about the BBM's issue in the middle of last September.
The procces of crawling, cleaning, toknizing, etc until the wordcloud is done is provide in the link below.

I am eager to know what is people wondering about the increasing price of BBM in Indonesia. I got the data through crawling from twitter, because twitter is the most popular social media. The data contains 1000 tweets with keyword ‘bbm’ . Before i create the word cloud, of course i clean the data first to remove any unuseful component.

Package Used: twitteR, rtweet, dplyr, textclean, tm, wordcloud2
